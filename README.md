# Reinforcement_learning_with_connect4
First adventure doing something with reinforcement learning. Connect4 seems like a good choice, 
with a kaggle competition already dedictated to it (https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectx/overview),
implementation of the game is straightforward and so I can just focus on learning algorithms.
